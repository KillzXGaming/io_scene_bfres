# io_scene_bfres

This is a Blender add-on to import the BFRES model file format, which is typically used in several Nintendo Wii U games.

It is currently in the alpha stage and supports the following features:
- Completely load the BFRES file structure into memory.
- Convert FMDL sections, creating FSHP polygons and FMAT materials.
- Converting all FTEX textures on the fly by delegating the conversion task to TexConv.

The following features are not implemented yet:
- Multiple UV layers
- Skeleton

Other features missing from the lists above are not planned at this time.
